# MazeGenerator
_Begin by entering your desired maze size into the console_

_Controls - Arrow Keys or WASD to move_

**You begin as a small red circle in the top left corner of a maze, cold and alone you begin to traverse the walls in hope of escape
after a short time period, a purple glow creeps from behind, run from the chaser and find the blue door to escape the maze!**
